The differences between the first and second program were as follows
-In Address book there is error checking while in the program that I created dose not
-In addition to having no error detection the entity created with errors is still added to the index
-I also can add my own id for my program while in address book it is auto generated
-In the maven 1 project that I created only has error checking for the id
-The font for lab1 is also a different size and colour than address book
-The background colour has changed and is also missing the header line
